    "## Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates how to perform model selection using the algorithm described in (Toni et al, 2009). The example here is adapted from the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model in Section 3.3 of the paper. The code to produce the result in the paper is available at the GitHub of the ABCSysBio Python package that accompanies the paper (https://github.com/jamesscottbrown/abc-sysbio/blob/master/examples/SBML/Example1/SIR.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The example gives two models that describe the evolution of the number of of susceptible ($S$), infected ($I$) and recovered ($R$) individuals in a population (the number of dead individuals is not included in the model).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possible models, both of which are described below. Given some observed data on the number of individuals in each disease state over time we wish to determine which of the two models is better supported by these data. The data was generated using the first model so the algorithm should reflect this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic SIR model assumes that each individual can be infected once and is then able to infect other individuals immediately. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\dot{S} &= \\alpha - \\gamma S I - d S, \\\\\n",

    "    \\dot{R} &= v I - d R \\, ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the notation $\\dot{x}$ denotes $\\text{d}x/\\text{d}t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paramters of this model are the birth rate $\\alpha$, the infection rate $\\gamma$, the recovery rate $v$ and the death rate $d$. Note that the death rate is constant for all three disease states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 2\n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly more sophisticated model includes a time delay between an individual becoming infected and being able to infect others by introducing an additional latent state ($L$). This model is given by\n",
    "\n",

    "    \\dot{S} &= \\alpha - \\gamma S I - d S , \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "The ABC SMC algorithm for model selection is available in full in the paper by Toni et al (see references for link). If using full model simulations the algorithm takes the following inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a prior over the models (the default in GpABC is a discrete uniform prior),\n",
    "* a schedule of thresholds for each ABC run (the first is rejection ABC and the subsequent runs are ABC SMC),\n",
    "* parameter priors for each candidate model,\n",
    "* a maximum number of accepted particles per population, and\n",
    "* a maximum number of iterations per population (default 1000).\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is an ABC algorithm observed (reference) data, a distance metric and summary statistic must also be defined. As for other GpABC functions euclidean distance is the default distance metric. \n",
